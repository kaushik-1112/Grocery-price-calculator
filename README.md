The Grocery Price Calculator application is a convenient tool designed in flutter to simplify the management of grocery lists and calculate the total price of items. The application effectively integrates Hive for NoSQL database operations and Shared Preferences for seamless data transfer between pages. By leveraging these technologies, the application ensures efficient management of grocery lists and accurate price calculations while providing a user-friendly experience. This combination of Hive and Shared Preferences contributes to the reliability, speed, and functionality of the application, making it a valuable tool for users to streamline their grocery shopping experience.

1)	Utilizing Hive for NoSQL Database Operations:  Hive Database: Hive is a lightweight and efficient NoSQL database solution tailored for Flutter applications. Data Persistence: Hive provides fast and persistent storage for structured data, making it ideal for managing dynamic grocery lists. 
CRUD Operations: The application seamlessly performs CRUD operations: Create (Add Item): New grocery items are added to the database with details such as name, quantity, price, and date. Read (View Items): Items are retrieved from the Hive database and displayed for user viewing. Update (Edit Item): Existing items can be modified, and the changes are updated in the database. Delete (Remove Item): Items are easily removed from the database upon user request. 

2)	Leveraging Shared Preferences for Data Transfer:  Data Sharing Between Pages: Shared Preferences, a key-value pair storage mechanism in Flutter, is utilized for transferring data between pages. Sending Data to Final Page: When the user decides to view the final grocery list, the application stores the list data in Shared Preferences before navigating to the Final Page. Retrieving Data in Final Page: Upon reaching the Final Page, the application retrieves the stored grocery list data from Shared Preferences for display and further processing.
